# Homework Assignment #5: Basic Loops

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.

- For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For the multiples of five print "Buzz".
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
- Instead of only printing "fizz", "buzz", and "fizzbuzz", add a fourth print statement: "prime". You should print this whenever you encounter a number that is prime (divisible only by itself and one).

## Run in terminal
`python main.py`
